## Blog Application
Express Thoughts blog was created as a capstone project for the Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp course, taught by Dr. Angela Yu, on Udemy.
Project Description: The goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. 
The application allows users to create, view and edit blog posts. Blog posts do not persist between sessions as no database was used in this version of the application.
The project was built to meet the capstone expectations, in terms of the deliverables as well as the feature and technical requirements. 
But I have added a few extras to make it stand out and to fully test my understanding of the entire course content leading up to the capstone.

Here is a brief description of some of my main extras:

### Home and About Pages
I included a home page designed to be a welcoming space that inspires visitors to engage with their own thoughts. 
It reflects the blog's core philosophy: that authentic thoughts have the potential to shape the world, and deserve to be shared. 
I also included an about page that presents the blog's core philosophy, and my extra features.

### Login and Sign Up
Users will be able to read existing blog posts. However, to be able to write a new post or update one, users are required to create an account and login. 
Note that user accounts do not persist between sessions.

### Comments and Reactions
Users will be able to comment on and react to existing blog posts, upon login. Note also that since there's no database, comments and reactions do not persist between sessions. 
Unfortunately, I handed-in my work before completing the codes for reactions (likes, dislikes and favourites). 
That means that users are able to add comments to the main post, but not able to react to posts or comments.

### Other Incomplete Extras
I included a subscription form in the main footer, to complete the blog project with a call to action feature for visitors. 
I decided, for no particular reason, to skip the form submission before handing-in my project.
